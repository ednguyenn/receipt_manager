create ECS cluster -> create load balancer listen to port 80
create target group (select IP instead of instance for FARGATE deployment) - listen to container expose port
security group should allow port 80 and all traffic will go to specific security group ID with fargate services
create task definition with appropriate permissions (Textract, DynamoDB, S3) for Taskrole - add environment variables into task definition json 
create service to host task definition and deploy.
